## 2.7.0

**Release date: April 17th, 2018**

### Removed support for Windows XP, MacOS 9 and MacOS 10

These platforms were not able to work properly with the browser versions that we officially support. In some cases e.g. MacOS10 in combination with Firefox browser, the selenium driver v3.8.1, which is the official selenium version that we support, is simply not supported for these old platforms. By removing support for these old platforms we are able to focus more on the performance for the platforms that are used much more in the real world.

### Removed support for Testingbot

Testingbot did not support the latest browsers versions and/or the latest selenium driver versions for some platforms. Because of this and the fact that it was almost not used in ATS we decided to drop support for it, choosing instead to focus on the other providers which support the newest versions of browsers and drivers.

### Integrated function documentation in ATS

We understand that it is not optimal to have to switch to another page in order to check the documentation for a certain function in a test case. Therefore we integrated the function documentation into ATS itself. When searching for functions and also when editing a test step in a test case you can see the function documentation by hovering over the function name.
The same holds for the function parameters.
