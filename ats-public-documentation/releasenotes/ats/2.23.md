## 2.23

**Release date: February 16th, 2021**

### Dark theme support

We are proud to present support for dark theme powered by darkreader.org.
You can change your theme by clicking on your profile image to one of the following options:
- system (default) - match the theme to your OS preference
- dark - use a dark theme (NEW!)
- light - use a light theme (this is the standard theme that we have used since ATS v2)

### Improvements

* We slightly improved support for responsive mode. On smaller screns the side menu will now collapse into a slide over that can be toggled with a hamburger menu.
The primary use for this is the recording screen, where you might want to have the recording and the app that you are recording side by side.

### Fixes

* We fixed a bug where a scheduled test would not start without giving any error message.
* Due to a bug a job that failed during the initial stage would not show any logs. This has now been fixed.
* We fixed an issue where the logoff button would not work and instead show some json. It now works correctly by first logging out the user of their current ATS session then redirecting them to sprintr.
