* Due to popular request we have simplified the usage of XPath as a way to find elements. The function **Find/Assert Element by XPath** is now available under the **Web** category.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where clicking an item in the sidebar on menu did not work as expected when the menu was collapsed.
* Due to a bug in the firefox web driver clicking on a datagrid row did not work correctly for Firefox. We have implemented a workaround for this until the issue is addressed by Firefox.
