## Important remarks

### The links to other pages don't work, I had to add the missing _.md_ to the file name

Never link by using the full file name. Always omit the _.md_ extension. The links won't work in GitBook but on the Mendix website.

### Naming of files and folders

Please stick with the current naming conventions.

# FAQs

## I can't find what I'm looking for in the _TABLE OF CONTENTS_ tab, I have to look in the _FILES_ tab

The _TABLE OF CONTENTS_ tab is specific for GitBook. Any changes we do here are not reflected in the documentation when it is published. Please simply ignore this tab and work with the files directly.

## How can I see if I have made changes to a document?

The blue _Publish/Save_ button on the top right will be enabled if there are unsaved changes to the document.

## How do I switch to _raw_ mode to edit in Markdown?

Press the _?_ icon on the bottom right and enable _Edit Markdown_.

## I've made changes to a document but don't want to save them. How can I revert the changes on the document?

There are two options:

1. Use the undo function
2. In the left sidepanel, right click on the file and select _Discard Changes_

## I've made changes or created a new document and want it to be review before it's published. How do I do that?

Use the _Create a change request_ function top left. This will create a _Change request_ from the _Primary version_ with all your current unpublished changes. This _Change request_ can be reviewed by other users and merged into the _Primary version_.  
You can continue editing your _Change request_ after it has been created. To switch between the _Primary version_ and _Change requests_ use the link top left.  
Also see [What are Change Requests](https://help.gitbook.com/books/what-are-change-requests.html).

## I'm working with the _GitBook Editor_ desktop application. How do i see the latest changes from other users?

You can sync changes from other users by selecting the function _Sync_ in the _Book_ menu.

# I have feedback on the documentation. How do I communicate this feedback?

You can use the built-in comment function from GitBooks. It is only available in _Read_ mode.

1. Open the documentation in _Read_ mode [here](https://mansystems.gitbooks.io/ats-public-documentation/content/) or by clicking the _Read_ button.
1. Hover a text paragraph until you see the **+** button on the right.
