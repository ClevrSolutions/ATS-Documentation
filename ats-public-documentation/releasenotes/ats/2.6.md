## 2.6.0

**Release date: March 20th, 2018**

### Selective reporting

We know that the ability to generate reports is important in order to get an overview of software quality. This is why we are always looking for ways to improve the reporting capabilities of ATS. Starting with this release it is now possible to configure a custom report that only contains test cases and/or test suites that you want to be part of the report. This functionality is available through the dashboard, by clicking the *Download report* button* which opens a dialog with two options for reporting: *All* and *Selected*. When you choose *All* the PDF report contains all test cases and suites in the project, same as the default behavior until now. When you choose *Selected* then you can customize the report by specifying which test cases, test suites and folders should be included in the report.
