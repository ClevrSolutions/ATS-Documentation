## 1 Introduction

This how-to explains how to create a test case, add test steps manually, and add test steps using the ATS Recorder. A test case consists of test steps that contain actions. Each action (like clicking a button) performs a task.

This how-to uses the Mendix Company Expenses app as an example, and you will create a test case that submits a new expense in this app. You create the same test case twice, once manually, and once with the ATS Recorder. 

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Create a new test case
* Add test steps to your test case manually
* Add test steps using the ATS Recorder
