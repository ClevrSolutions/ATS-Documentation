## 2.4.1

**Release date: February 05th, 2018**

### Fixes

- It is not possible to import an item into a project, when the parent folder of the item still exists in another project. This has been fixed.
- It could happen, that a imported item has a test step which refers to an item of another app. That is not possible anymore.
- During the import of some test data, the imported failed due to an internal error. This has been improved.
