## 2.12

**Release date: July 9th 2019**

### Test step settings

Additional settings for test steps allow you to:

* disable a test step (for test suites, test cases and actions) - the step will behave same as if it was deleted.
* abort execution on not passed (for test suites with sequential execution) - if a step fails then the rest of the test suite will not be executed at all
* negate the assert in a test case - e.g. when Find/Assert Dialog can be negated to assert that there is no dialog. Here is a complete list of all the functions that can be negated.
```
> Logic
    > Assert Contains String
    > Assert endsWith
    > Assert startsWith
    > Assert equalTo¹
    > Assert equalToIgnoringCase
    > Assert equalToIgnoringWhitespace

> Web
    > Assert Element Attribute Equals
    > Assert Element Matches Selector
    > Find Element
    > Find Element By Id
    > Find Element By CSS
    > Find Element By Sizzle

> Mendix
    > Assert Current Page Title

> Widget:Find
    > Find Checkbox Set Selector
    > Find DataGrid Row
    > Find/Assert Dialog
    > Find Grid Selector
    > Find Item/Row
    > Find Menu Item
    > Find Selected Item/Row
    > Find Widget Child Node
    > Find/Assert Widget²

> Widget:Assert
    > Assert Active Tab Name
    > Assert Checkbox Set Selector Value
    > Assert Checkbox Value
    > Assert Grid Selector Value
    > Assert Simple Checkbox Set Selector Value
    > Assert Validation Message

¹  Assert not equalTo, assert null, assert not null, assert not true, assert not false have all been deprecated in favor of Assert equalTo.
²  Assert Widget Value has been deprecated in favor of Find/Assert Widget.
```

### Improvements

* Reduce the timeout for Set Value from 60 seconds to 5 seconds. This helps the test fail faster when a widget is not found or not editable.

### Fixes

* We fixed a bug where the function name was not shown for a test step with no parameters (for test cases and actions). 
* We fixed a bug where in in rare circumstances logs would be missing for test cases.
