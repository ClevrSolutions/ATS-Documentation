## 2.13

**Release date: July 27th 2019**

### Mendix 8 compatibility

ATS is now compatibile with Mendix version 8 ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### Upgraded Selenium from version 3.8 to version 3.141.59

This lets ATS run testx on the latest browser versions which gives improvements in both speed and stability.  
If you are using Browserstack or Saucelabs ATS will automatically use the new version and you do not have to do anything.  
If you use another selenium hub we highly recommend to update it to use selenium version 3.141.59 as the current version will no longer be supported. You can the download selenium version 3.141.59 from the [official website](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).


### Improvements

* We improved the performance when processing test results
* The error log tab now shows the exact date and time when a test case is started and when it has finished with execution.


### Fixes

* In some cases the automatic wait did not work correctly for Firefox. This is now fixed.
