## 2.9.0

**Release date: July 10th, 2018**

### No access app role

It is now possible specify that certain members of a project in Sprintr do not get any access to the project in ATS. This can be configured by app administrators from the _App settings_ page. Members of an app that have the _No access_ role will not see this app in their _My apps_ page and will not be able to view or edit or run test cases from this app. Note that _SCRUM Masters_ in Spintr will always keep the administrator role in ATS.

### Default app role

We have implemented a functionality to set a default role per app. This role will be applied to new members of the app. The default role can be changed by app administrators under _App settings_. Please note that _SCRUM masters_ in Sprintr will get an administrator role in ATS even if the default role is set to _No access_ or _Tester_.

### On-Premises

We are reintroducing On-Premises as a deployment option for ATS. To this end we introduced a new user role _Tenant administrator_ which will only be used in On-Premises instances of ATS. The tenant administrator will be able to create and edit accounts and apps. Check the [ATS reference guide for more details on tenant administration](./../../ats/refguide/rg-version-2/administration.md).

### Fixes

* Due to a bug it was not possible to export the documentation for test cases/suites which had a description longer than 200 characters. This is now fixed.

### Known Limitations

* Regarding _Nanoflows_, we have not explicitly tested their impact on ATS, but so far we have not received issue reports related to them.
