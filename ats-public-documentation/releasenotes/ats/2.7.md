## 2.7.0

**Release date: April 17th, 2018**

### Removed support for Windows XP, MacOS 9 and MacOS 10

These platforms were not able to work properly with the browser versions that we officially support. In some cases e.g. MacOS10 in combination with Firefox browser, the selenium driver v3.8.1, which is the official selenium version that we support, is simply not supported for these old platforms. By removing support for these old platforms we are able to focus more on the performance for the platforms that are used much more in the real world.

### Removed support for Testingbot

Testingbot did not support the latest browsers versions and/or the latest selenium driver versions for some platforms. Because of this and the fact that it was almost not used in ATS we decided to drop support for it, choosing instead to focus on the other providers which support the newest versions of browsers and drivers. If you still have this provider configured as a hub, you can no longer use it to run jobs. Any schedules or job templates that are configured to use this provider will return an error when executed.

### Integrated function documentation in ATS

We understand that it is not optimal to have to switch to another page in order to check the documentation for a certain function in a test case. Therefore we integrated the function documentation into ATS itself. When searching for functions and also when editing a test step in a test case you can see the function documentation by hovering over the function name.
The same holds for the function parameters.

### Data driven test cases

* We added the option to sequentially execute data driven test cases (DDTC). Until now DDTCs were always executed in parallel. We have now made it possible to chose if you want to execute DDTCs parallel or sequentially, i.e. one-by-one. The selection works in exactly the way it works for test suites, but it is only available for test cases that are related to a data set. This overcomes issues where DDTC could be interfering with each other because they were always running in parallel.
* We have also added the screenshot feature to data driven test cases. Whenever a data driven test case fails for a given record in the data set, a screen shot will be recorded and will be accessible in the logs. This will work in the same way as it is working now for standard test cases.
* Selecting a data set for a test case now uses the sidebar search dialog.


### Improvements

* We sped up the opening of the edit page for large data sets.
* When editing a value for parameter of type number it is now possible to use the edit dialog, same as for text parameters.
* When running from Browserstack or Saucelabs we select by default the Windows 10 platform and FullHD resolution. For MacOS the resolution UXGA is selected by default. We hope that this will save a few clicks.
* We have changed the platform selection to use icons instead of a dropdown. This also enabled us to limit the choices to only those which make sense, for example you can no longer select Internet Explorer and MacOS.

### Fixes

* Due to an artificial limitation only the first 20 fields were shown when editing a dataset. This limitation has been removed.
* When a test step in the logs refers to a function it is not possible to open/edit this function. However, due to a bug the edit icon was still shown for such test steps. This has been fixed.
* When a test case with an empty test step in the middle was executed, the test case failed with a null pointer exception. This is now fixed and the empty test step is not interfering with the execution.
* In some cases the tooltip for action/parameter documentation was not showing the full description. This is now fixed.
