## 2.3.0

**Release date: November 20th, 2017**

### Improvements

- The buttons visible on top of the list of teststeps when editing a testcase, testsuite or action where not visible when you have many steps and scroll down in the list. These are now fixed on top.

### Fixes

- The teststep type (setup/regular/teardown) is not refreshed when changed by drag and drop a step. The type is now also refreshed in the client.
- Adding a step in a test suite does remove the teststep numbers and cause a random order of the steps. This is now fixed.
- Adding the first parameter, or remove the last parameter of a action does not update the visibility of the parameter section in the action calls using the modified action. This is now fixed.
- Cancel a running testsuite will cancel the testsuite, but the reminded test case still running. All test suites and test cases in the job are cancelled now, if they're still running or queued. Test cases/suites that had already finished before keep their result (passed or failed).
- The tab error log for failed test suites is visible, but shows no logs. The error log tab is not visible for testsuites anymore.
