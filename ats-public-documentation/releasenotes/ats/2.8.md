## 2.8.0

**Release date: June 15th, 2018**

### Mendix 7.13 & 7.14

Mendix applications which are based on Mendix version 7.13 or 7.14, can now be tested and recorded with ATS.

### Cancelling
* We have completely redesigned the back-end for canceling jobs. You will see that cancelled jobs stop executing much faster than before. Steps which are interruptible e.g. sleep will be interrupted immediately instead of waiting them to finish. We also update the status for test cases or suites which were not started at the time of cancelling. 

### Improvements
* We have made several changes to the wait function making it more stable, especially when running on slow devices or slow selenium servers. 
* When testing on mobile devices we now simulate setting dropdown values via the native dialogs for mobile, same as we do for date and time dialogs.
* We made changes to how recordings are handled internally which makes saving and cancelling a recording much faster.

### Fixes

### Known Limitations
* On Mendix 7.13 and above, in some circumstances tests will not wait for microflows which are executed asynchronously to finish executing before proceeding. This can cause tests to fail. A temporary workaround is to add a "Sleep" with a sufficient duration after clicking a button which calls an asynchronous microflow.
* Regarding _Nanoflows_, we have not explicitly tested their impact on ATS, but so far we have not received issue reports related to them.
