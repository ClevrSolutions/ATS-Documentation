## 2.8.0

**Release date: June 15th, 2018**


### Cancelling
* We have completely redesigned the back-end for canceling jobs. You will see that cancelled jobs stop executing much faster than before. Steps which are interruptible e.g. sleep will be interrupted immediately instead of waiting them to finish. We also update the status for test cases or suites which were not started at the time of cancelling. 

### Improvements
* We have made several changes to the wait function making it more stable, especially when running on slow devices or slow selenium servers. 
* When testing on mobile devices we now simulate setting dropdown values via the native dialogs for mobile, same as we do for date and time dialogs.
* We made changes to how recordings are handled internally which makes saving and cancelling a recording much faster.
