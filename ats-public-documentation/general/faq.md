## 1 General Questions

### 1.1 What is ATS and why should I use it?

The Mendix Application Test Suite (ATS) is a suite of tools for embedding (automated) testing in your application lifecycle.  It provides a powerful solution for automation of not only your functional and regression tests but also non-functional tests like availability, security, and performance testing. Furthermore, with functions like a test case recorder and data-driven testing, it provides you with everything you need to make testing your Mendix apps quick, easy and versatile. 

A small investment in setting up ATS, which is very easy to learn, will save a lot of (re)testing time in the long run. This will help the team and its stakeholders to have the right insights into the quality of your app, at any time, at the press of a button.

In short, ATS brings you the following benefits:

1. Faster delivery

2. Find more regressions

3. A more testable product

4. Improved testing morale

## 1.2 ATS uses selenium, so why should I use ATS in combination with Selenium instead of solely using Selenium?
