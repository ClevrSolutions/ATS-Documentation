## 2.11

**Release date: June 4th 2019**

### Extended API

As more people embrace CI/CD in the development process we saw a need for more information and functionality out of our API. 

On the functionality side, we added the operation **Rerun not passed** to the ATS API. Now you can set up your CI/CD pipeline to rerun failed test cases.

On the information side we added options to retrieve the following data for a job suing the existing **GetJobStatus** operation:

* flags (cancelled and warning)
* breakdown per test case i.e. number of passed/failed/not executed test cases
* details per test case with name, result, duration and error message.

For all the details make sure to check the [ATS 2 Reference guide](./../../ats/refguide/rg-version-2/cicd-api.md).
