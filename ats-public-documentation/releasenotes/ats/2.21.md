## 2.21

**Release date: October 11th, 2020**

### New Test Runner

The team is always looking for ways to improve the speed and scalability of ATS.
Therefore we have decided to revamp the test runner (the component responsible for orchestrating and executing tests).
The new **Version 2** test runner will be hosted in the Azure cloud as opposed to the Mendix cloud.

To make the transition painless, the old runner (now called *version 1*) will remain in service for some time.
If you run into any issues with the new version 2 runner it will be possible to switch back to the version 1 runner from the test settings page.
It is also possible to select a default runner for all tests within an app from the app settings menu.

### Improvements

* Test configuration no longer shows all settings by default. Only the most frequently changed settings are shown, the rest are under a new **Advanced** button.

### Fixes

* Due to a bug it was not possible to download recording from ATSelenium. This is now fixed.
