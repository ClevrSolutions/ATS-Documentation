# Function API

The Function API is a REST API that allows ATS functions to be called from any testing tool or programing environment.
The function is executed against a selenium session that is specified in the request.

Lets illustrate this with a simple example of using the *Get Value* function.
To run this functions one needs to send a POST request to the endpoint `http://ats100.mendixcloud.com/function` with the following body:

```json
{
    "remoteSeleniumDriver": {
        "url"      : "https://selenium.com/wd/hub",
        "sessionId": "00bef045-e9c9-4677-8cc1-e084bab7476b"
    },
    "functionToExecute": {
        "key": "GetValue",
        "values": [
            {
                "key"  : "WidgetName",
                "value": "widget1"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
where

**_remoteSeleniumDriver_** - is a reference to a remote selenium session that consists of a selenium driver URL (which needs to be publicly accessible) and a session id.
ATS will use this session to execute the function specified under

**_functionToExecute_** - defines which ATS function to execute. The function and values are identified by their key (guaranteed to be unique) that can be found [here](functions_api_reference.md).
The order of the values is not relevant and optional parameter (default to null) unless a values is specified.

If the function execution was successful ATS will respond with

```json
{
   "result"     : "PASSED",
   "returnValue": "Lorem ipsum"
}
```

###  Authentication

Uses the [Basic auth](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7617) with the project id as username and an API key as password. 

### Schemas

* [Request](../function-api-reference/functions_api_request.schema.json)
* [Response](../function-api-reference/functions_api_response.schema.json)

### Passing web elements

Web elements are passed by their internal Selenium ID which is in essence a string. To indicate that a parameter or a return value is a web element and not a string the flag `isWebElement` needs to be set to true.

### Dialects

Modern selenium uses a dialect known as _W3C_ by default to talk to browser drivers. However if for any reason you need to use the old _OSS_ dialect, that needs to be passed explicitly in the call:

```json
    "remoteSeleniumDriver": {
        "url"      : "https://selenium.com/wd/hub",
        "sessionId": "00bef045-e9c9-4677-8cc1-e084bab7476b",
        "dialect"  : "OSS"
    },
```

## Clients

Clients are available for the function API for the following tools:

* java
* Katalon

The clients allow one to use the function API via a simplified interface without having to deal with parsing and formatting json and building http requests. In addition the clients automatically detect the remote session url and id as well as the dialect used so that this does not have to be specified manually.

#### Java

Add `ats.jar` to the project's buildpath. Optionally, configure source and javadoc. Here is a simple example:

```java
ATSSettings atsSettings = new ATSSettings(projectId, apiKey);
ATSRunner ats = new ATSRunner(atsSettings , driver);

ats.Mendix.OpenMendixApplication("https://www.example.com");

ats.Widget_Set.SetValue("textBox1", "Lorem ipsum", null);

```

#### Katalon

Add `ats.jar` to the plugins folder. The ATS functions are available as custom keywords and in groovy. The authentication can be configured under ATS Settings.

```groovy
WebUI.openBrowser('')

// ATS functions called as custom keyword
CustomKeywords.'ats.Mendix.OpenMendixApplication'('https://www.example.com')
CustomKeywords.'ats.Widget_Set.SetValue'('textBox1', 'Lorem ipsum', null)

// ATS function called as groovy function
ats.Widget_Set.SetValue("textBox1", "Lorem ipsum", null);
```

## Limitations

The Function API is a beta feature. If you are interested in trying it out please contact support. Keep in mind there might be further changes to the functionality.

A limit of 20 active requests at a given time applies per project. Additionally, excessive usage is discouraged and may lead to revoking of the API key (e.g. one hundred thousands calls per day). 

All HTTP requests are synchronous meaning that they will time out after roughly 1 minute. This is due to the nature of HTTP communication. There is no way to extend this timeout.

In order for ATS to automate the selenium session the selenium driver must be on a URL that is publicly accessible.

Only selenium version 3.141.59 is supported. Other automation technologies such as e.g. cypress are not supported. 

Mobile testing is not supported.
